### Waterius can sends:
- current values everyday
- delta values (per day)
- voltage
- e-mail by Blynk (title and message template)
- data to your TCP server
- low voltage detector (experimental)

Values saved in ATtiny EEPROM cycle buffer (~2 millions cycles). "Software ESD protection".

### How It Works
*Two chips*: ATtiny85 in deep sleep mode. It counts impulses and wakes up ESP-01 to transfer data to Blynk every day. Chips talks by i2c line.

*Power*: 3*AA batteries (or 2*AA lithium batteries without voltage regulator)

*Current*: 15-24 uA in deep sleep, 75 mA when transmitting for ~5 sec

*Lifetime*: estimated 4 year battery life

*Limits*: 2 impulses per second (increased by constant in code)

*Inputs*: 2 water meters
